When the Ukranian crisis happened in February, I realised that I knew frighteningly little about geography. While I started swatting up on countries and capitals, I took Jessica Hische's Skillshare class of drop caps. I'd been thinking of doing the book Dubliners as a title and then realised I could combine the two.

Obviously this project owes a lot to Jessica Hische's [Daily Drop Cap](http://dailydropcap.com) project. Hi Jessica!
