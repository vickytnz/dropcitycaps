Bamako is the capital of Mali.
##Process

Bamako means 'crocodile river', so I was keen to try and weave this into the explorations. 

I'd originally played around with ways of incorporating a crocodile and a river in the old fashioned dropcap style (i.e. adding an image to text).

However, I'd been playing with different Bs in Fontbook and realised I could use a blackletter style letter as a way to show both the crocodile and the river.

Which I sketched and figured out the skeleton for.

I was interested in the idea of merging the crocodile and the river with a pattern going from green to blue, so tried out making a pattern brush.

It looked great (and actually might be good for the Beijing capital which is coming up soon), but it didn't look very crocodile.

After looking around online for patterns, I followed [a tutorial to make leather textures in Photoshop](http://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-your-own-leather-texture-using-adobe-illustrator--vector-5572), used this as a clipping mask and then used the path finder to make a clean image.

Which gives the final product:

It also looks *amazing* on black.
