Berin is the capital of Germany.
##Process
For all of the history of Berlin, when it comes down to it the name and crest comes down to a bear. 
Which as it turns out, is harder to turn into a B than one might think.

The final image attempts to use something of the bear shape (nose, claws etc) whilst still being a B, and using some references to black letter.
