Asmara is the capital of Eritea.

##Process
The story behind Asmara's name is my favourite to date. There were four warring tribes in the area. Frustrated at the men being lost, the women in the four tribes banded together and forged peace. The name therefore means "peace by women".
The area in general is unusual in that Italian is one of the predominant languages.
My sketches attempted to use these four women joined in peace as a symbol.

After the first round though, I wasn't that happy with the execution, so had another go (also using my newly found wonder of Illustrator brushes)
