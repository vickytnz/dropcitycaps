Banjul is the capital of Gambia.
##Process
Banjul means 'fibre', from the fibrous ropes the local people used to make. 
It seemed natural to make a rope based letter. 

I have to admit being somewhat inspired by [the Designtuts article on making a pattern brush with Illustrator](http://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/use-a-pattern-brush-to-create-a-rope-text-effect-in-illustrator--vector-24814) even if I did end up using someone else's brush instead.
