Baghdad is the capital of Iraq.

##Process

Reading [the Wikipedia page for Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad) isn't pleasant going for the most part. (I hated reading about how most of the animals at Baghdad Zoo died during the 2003 invasion).
Still, there are positives: it was once renowned for its gardens and libraries. 

What I found interesting was the shape of the city and the name relating to it.

It seems Baghdad is one of the few places that was entirely constructed in relation to religious observances. What's particularly interesting is that it's a circle.

Having just watched some [Skillshare classes about hand lettering](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/The-First-Steps-of-Hand-Lettering-Concept-to-Sketch-Lettering-I/389616295), I decided to try some good ol' pen and paper exercises, though I was above all most interested in making a round B.

The final picture is meant to be a bird's eye view on the city. (Making it true bird's eye view is what made it work).
