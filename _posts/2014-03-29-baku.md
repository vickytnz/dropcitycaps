"Baku" is the capital of Azerbaijan.
##Process

[Baku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku) stands for 'wind blown' (which means the Eurovision 2012 logo now makes a bit more sense), and the city's shield also includes a fire, so I was interested in playing around with these. B lends itself pretty well to that type of shape.
