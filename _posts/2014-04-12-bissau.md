Bissau is the capital of Guinea-Bissau.
##Process
It actually takes a lot of work to find out anything about the actual city of Bissau and the meaning of its name: I had to go to [Every Culture](http://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Guinea-Bissau.html) to find something:

> "Guinea" was used by European explorers and traders to refer the coast of West Africa. It comes from an Arabic term meaning "the land of the blacks." "Bissau," the name of the capital, may be a corruption of "Bijago," the name of the ethnic group that inhabits the dozens of small islands along the coast. The combined name distinguishes the country from its southern neighbor, Guinea.

Reading more generally about Guinea-Bissau, their flag and recent politics has explictly set out to be pan-African and tone down ethnic differences, so I've chosen the colours of the flag and the star from the flag to show diversity.
