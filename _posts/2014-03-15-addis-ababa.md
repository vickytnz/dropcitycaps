Addis Ababa is the capital of Ethiopia.

##Process

I've always associated Ethiopia with droughts. So I was fascinated to find out that the name of its capital means 'new flower', and in fact that flowers were a big part of their industry (though I couldn't tell if they export).

I have to admit that this cap took many cues from [Jessica Hische's similar one](http://www.dailydropcap.com/alphabet-6-a), though this one uses the colour of the Ethiopian flag.
