Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
##Process
Bangkok is known for a lot of things, er, akin to Amsterdam. Again, I looked at etymology. There are some different explanations of the name (already harbours and rivers are a recurring theme). However [it's suggested that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok) the town name comes from a particular plant—"shortened from Bang Makok (บางมะกอก), makok being the name of Elaeocarpus hygrophilus, a plant bearing olive-like fruit" (yes, Wikipedia)—which is what I'm exploring here.

I'm keen to keep the text legible where possible. When playing around with Illustrator I realised that I could show the white flowers as negative space, which was a nice surprise.
