Bandar Beri Begawan is the capital of Brunei.
##Process
While Bandar Beri Begawan is interesting as port, what is really interesting is their city of houses on the water (giving it the name 'The Venice of the East' in the 1500s). 

I decided to find a way to use this, and fixed on the negative space in the B.
