Bangui is the capital of Central African Republic.
##Process
Another river related city! Reading about Bangui, I'd been interested that there was a connection to rapids, namely the rapids that gave the river Ubangui its name which in term led to the name of the city. 
I liked the idea of playing with stones, rapids and eddys to make the shape. There was an irony that the image I found as a good references was from New Zealand. We have many rapids.

It took shape pretty quickly.
