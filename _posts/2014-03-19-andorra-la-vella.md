Andorra la Vella is the capital of Andorra.

##Process
Apparently people go to Andorra for two things: duty free shopping and skiiing. I didn't really want to do something about shopping (though on hindsight it could be worth a try).

The town itself also has nice stonework and buildings, which is also echoed in the colours chosen.
